## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html) - JS with types
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I started learning TypeScript while working on this challenge and it wasn't fun at first but I've come to love it now.

I also learned about adding drag and drop using react beautiful dnd.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log('🎉');
};
```

### Continued development

- use firebase for storgage and authentication

### Useful resources

- [implement drag and drop](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-add-drag-and-drop-in-react-with-react-beautiful-dnd/) - This helped me with implementing the drag and drop feature using react beautiful dnd.
- [Learn TypeScript](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_getstarted.php) - This is an amazing resource which helped me with learning typescript. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in getting started with typescript.
